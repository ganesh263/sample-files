THE STORY OF THE JACKAL AND THE DRUM
"There was once a jackal called 'Gomaya*. One day,
he was very hungry arid he wandered about in search
of food. At last he came to a battlefield. The fighting
armies had left behind a drum, lying near some creepers.
Because of a strong wind, the creepers were rubbing
against the drum and making a noise. When the 'jackal
heard this, he got frightened and thought to himself,
'Unless I can make myself scarce before whoever is
making this noise sees me, I am done for. But then, it
is unwise to desert one's house suddenly, so instead I
must try to find out who is making this noise.'
"So he took all his courage in his hands and as he
crept forward he realised that it was only a drum. He
continued his search and nearby he found sufficient
fool'l to last him a long time.
-"-''And, so you see," Damanaka went on, "you-shiluldn't
be afraid of a mere noise.''
-"How can I be brave," said Pingalaka, "when my whole
court is trembling with fright and wants to get away
from here?"
-"Master," said Damanaka, "servants should not be held
responsible for they only follow their master's example.
They say:
' 'Horses, �eapons, books, conversation,
The harp and a wife,
They all become worthy or worthless
According to the man they belong to.'
-"And so," continued Damanaka, "be brave and wait
here patiently until I return. I am gding to find out
about the noise. And then we shall do whatever is for
the best."
-"Are· you brave enough to go?.'' asked Pingalaka.
-"Certainly," said Damanaka, "besides, why should a
servant ask questions whether a thing is to be done or
not, if it is his ma.ste.r's pleasure.''
CONFLICT AMONGST FRIENDS 13
-· "My, dear friend I" said Pingalaka. "Well, if that's the
case, then by all means, go. May God protect you."
Damanaka bowed before the king and set out, following
the noise made by Sanjivaka.
,
After the jackal had taken his leave, Pinga'.laka got
frightened. He sank into a deep reverie and began to
think to himself, "I have made a mistake in confiding
my intentions to him. As I deprived him of his position,
he may join hands with my enemy and thus revenge
himself on me. And so I shall hide somewhere so as
to ·find out wh�t he is u,p to and to make sure that . he
does .rot lead my enemy straight here to �:ll me,. for
they say:
'A strong man ·who puts his faith in others,
May pay with his life,
But a weakling who is always wary,
Escapes death,
Even at the hands of the stro:p.gest of men.' "
And so having come to tliis decision; Pingalaka took
off and waited anxiously foi Damanaka's return.
In- the meantime, Damanaka .came near to where
Sanjivaka was, and realised that it was only a bullock,
making the noise. He was overjoyed, thinking to himself,
"This is a lucky omen: now I shall have Pingalaka under
my thumb because I have the power to make him and
this bullock friends or enemies, whichever � choose, for:
'As a man in good health requires n6' doctor I
So a king free from troubles pays no att.ention to
his minister.' "
With these thoughts, Damanaka returned and searched
out Pingalaka. Bowing before him, he took his place.
-"So did you se,e him?" asked Pingalaka.
·
-"With your good favour I have seen him," replied
Damanaka.
-"Honestly?" asked Pingalaka. "Are you telling the
truth?"
-"Do you think anyone would dare lie to you?" said
Damanaka.
