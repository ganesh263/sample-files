"But, do tell me," said R,arataka, "what will you say
to hi:µi to begin with?"
.
-"Whatever I say," said Damanaka, "must be said at
the right time for, even if Brihaspati* himself speaks at
the wrong moment, he will be insulted."
�"But it's so difficult to influence kings", said Karataka.
"They are hard and heartless as the mountains and are
surrounded by wicked pe.ople."
-"That is true," said Da(manaka, "but:
'If a king is angry he must be flattered.
His friend should be considered a friend,
His enemy, an enemy.
And his presents '
· should be appreciated.
In this way he can be won over without magic.' "
-"If that's the case," said Karataka, "then it's up to
you. May Goa protect you."
·
Damanaka bowed, took leave of Karataka and then
went straight to the king. As soon as Pingalaka saw
Damanaka coming, he said to his guard, "Let Damanaka,
the son of my former minister, come in without any
hindrance."
When Damanaka arrived, Pingalaka spoke kindly to
him.
-'.'Are you happy?" he asked. "Why have you CQme to
see me after such a long time?"
--"Your Majesty!" replied Damanaka. "Although my
master has no particular work for me, yet I must still
offer my services when the occasion demands. The king
needs all three types of people: High, middle and low.
And they say:
'If the king needs a little stick
To pick his ear or tooth,
How . much more does he need a man
Who ,has hands and the power of speech?'
-"Although we were always with you as your servants,
even llowed you in bad time

blame you, not the man who replaced us, for:
'A king who does not understand the difference
Between glass and diamonds,
Does not deserve to be served.
For how can a person of intelligence
Remain even for a moment
Jn a place, where men are unable to differentiate
.Between right and wrong.
And conversely the servant who deserves to serve,
Is the man who, when honoured, remains humble,
When ·insulted, keeps a scowl from his face
And thus remains equally detached
From honour and insult.
For kings and servants mutually depend on each
other:
There can be no king without a servant
And no servant without a king.
When a king is pleased, he gives to his servants
Gold in abundance
And they in return for such honour,
Sacrifice themselves to him.'
-"It is unbefitting that you should think us inferior
just because we are jackals, for:
'Silk comes out of the worm,
Gold out of the rocks,
The lotus from filth,
Fire from a piece of wood,_
And the gem from the hood of the cobra*.'
-"So, too," continued Damanaka, "virtue-
-
can come out
of people humbly born."
Said Pingalaka, "It makes no difference whether you
are high or low, you are the son of my former mini_
s_
ter,
so if you have anything to say, say it without hesitation."
-"Master!" said Damanaka. "Indeed I have something
to say."
-"Well then," said Pingalaka, "tell me."
-"But, I must tell you in confidenc¢," said Damanaka,imagine
