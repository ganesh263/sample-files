The Panchatantra isn't one single story but a collection of ancient Indian animal fables, written to teach wisdom, ethics, and statecraft, structured around five books (Mitra Bheda, Mitra Labha, Suhrud Bheda, Vigraha, Sandhi). Famous tales include The Lion and the Mouse (friendship & kindness, mice free a trapped lion), The Monkey and the Crocodile (betrayal, crocodile tricks monkey for his heart), and the Three Fish (foreseeing trouble), all emphasizing morals like trust, honesty, and the dangers of greed, often featuring clever animals outwitting foolish ones. 
aridatta was a Brahmin who was very poor. He was a farmer but
the piece of land he cultivated gave him very little to survive. One
day, unable to stand the heat of the summer sun, he went to a big
tree in his land to rest for a while. Before he could spread himself
on the ground he saw in the nearby anthill a huge cobra swaying
with his hood open.
He thought, “This cobra must really be the Goddess of this land. I
have never worshipped her, which is why I am not able to get
anything from the land. From today, I will worship her.”
At once he went back to his village and returned with a glass full of
milk.
He poured it in a bowl and turning to the anthill said, “O ruler of
the land, I did not know you were living in this anthill. That is why I
have not paid my tribute to you. Please excuse me and accept this
humble offering.”
He then placed the bowl of milk at the anthill and left the place.
