The Panchatantra isn't one single story but a collection of ancient Indian animal fables, written to teach wisdom, ethics, and statecraft, structured around five books (Mitra Bheda, Mitra Labha, Suhrud Bheda, Vigraha, Sandhi). Famous tales include The Lion and the Mouse (friendship & kindness, mice free a trapped lion), The Monkey and the Crocodile (betrayal, crocodile tricks monkey for his heart), and the Three Fish (foreseeing trouble), all emphasizing morals like trust, honesty, and the dangers of greed, often featuring clever animals outwitting foolish ones.
